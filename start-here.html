      This page explains what Rule-Based Biology is, why it exists, and how to navigate this site.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>What This Site Is</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology is a reconstruction of biological science based on the discovery
      of governing rules that determine how biological systems operate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a theory, not a model, and not a reinterpretation of existing biology.
      It is a framework built from identifying rules implicit in experimental data.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>Why This Site Exists</h3>
    <p>
      Modern biology accumulated enormous amounts of data but failed to converge
      on a coherent explanation of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This occurred because biology developed without a validated rule system.
      Without rules, data remains descriptive and often contradictory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this site is to present the consequences of discovering
      those missing rules.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>The Central Insight</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Rules give data meaning.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once rules are known:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Biological behavior becomes predictable</li>
      <li>Contradictions disappear</li>
      <li>Mechanisms become clear</li>
      <li>Understanding replaces memorization</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
  <h3>How This Work Began</h3>
  <p>
    The origin and reasoning behind Rule-Based Biology are explained in detail
    in the <a href="discovery-summary.html">Discovery Summary</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It describes how the governing rules were identified and why their discovery
    changes the foundation of biological science.
  </p>

  <p><em>This page explains the intellectual turning point behind the entire project.</em></p>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>How to Use This Site</h3>
    <p>
      This site is organized as a logical progression:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Why Biology Failed</strong> — explains the problem</li>
      <li><strong>Why Rules</strong> — explains why rules are necessary</li>
      <li><strong>Rule-Based Biology</strong> — presents the framework</li>
      <li><strong>Applications</strong> — shows what changes</li>
      <li><strong>AI & the Future</strong> — explains broader implications</li>
      <li><strong>Students & Careers</strong> — explains what this means for learning and work</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Readers are encouraged to follow this order.
    </p>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>What This Is Not</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Not a speculative theory</li>
      <li>Not an opinion piece</li>
      <li>Not an alternative biology</li>
      <li>Not a critique without resolution</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is a structural reorganization of biological understanding
      based on rule discovery.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>Who Should Read This</h3>
    <p>
      This site is intended for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Students seeking clarity</li>
      <li>Researchers seeking coherence</li>
      <li>Scientists questioning current frameworks</li>
      <li>Anyone interested in how life actually works</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Biology becomes intelligible when rules are known.<br>
      This site documents that transition.
