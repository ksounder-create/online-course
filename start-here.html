      This page is for readers encountering Rule-Based Biology for the first time.
      It explains what this project is, why it exists, and how to navigate it.

    <h3>What This Site Is</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology presents a unified framework for understanding life using
      governing principles rather than descriptive accumulation of data.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a theory, a hypothesis, or a speculative model.
      It is a reconstruction of biology based on rules that already exist in experimental data.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>Why This Site Exists</h3>
    <p>
      Modern biology has produced enormous amounts of data, yet fundamental questions
      remain unresolved: disease mechanisms, regulation, energy usage, and biological
      decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem is not lack of data — it is lack of governing rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site exists to show that once rules are identified, biological systems become
      coherent, predictable, and understandable.

    <h3>What This Is Not</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Not an opinion site</li>
      <li>Not speculative biology</li>
      <li>Not an alternative medicine platform</li>
      <li>Not a critique without solutions</li>

      The content here is based on internal consistency, logical necessity, and
      convergence of experimental evidence.

    <h3>How to Read This Site</h3>
    <p>
      Read slowly.  
      Follow the logic.  
      Do not assume prior biological training is required.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is understanding — not memorization.
