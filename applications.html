    <h2>Applications of Rule-Based Biology</h2>
    <p class="hero-text">
      When biology becomes lawful, its applications stop being experimental
      and start becoming predictable.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>1. Medicine: From Trial-and-Error to Mechanism</h3>
    <p>
      Modern medicine operates largely through empirical observation.
      Treatments work — or fail — without full mechanistic clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology changes this completely.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Disease mechanisms become definable</li>
      <li>Drug action becomes predictable</li>
      <li>Side effects become explainable</li>
      <li>Therapy becomes rational rather than empirical</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Medicine transitions from intervention to understanding.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>2. Diagnostics: From Markers to Mechanisms</h3>
    <p>
      Today’s diagnostics rely on correlations.
      Rule-Based Biology provides causation.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Biomarkers gain mechanistic meaning</li>
      <li>Disease staging becomes logical</li>
      <li>Progression becomes predictable</li>
      <li>Diagnosis becomes explanatory</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Diagnosis becomes understanding, not pattern recognition.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>3. Pharmacology: Predictability Replaces Probability</h3>
    <p>
      Drug discovery today is largely probabilistic.
      Rule-Based Biology introduces necessity.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Target behavior becomes predictable</li>
      <li>Off-target effects become understandable</li>
      <li>Drug interactions become computable</li>
      <li>Failure rates collapse</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Pharmacology becomes a science instead of an experiment.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>4. Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology</h3>
    <p>
      Biological systems can only be engineered when their rules are known.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cellular behavior becomes designable</li>
      <li>Pathways become controllable</li>
      <li>Biological output becomes tunable</li>
      <li>Complex systems become stable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Biology becomes an engineering discipline.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>5. Agriculture and Plant Science</h3>
    <p>
      Crop biology has long relied on breeding and observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology enables:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Predictable growth control</li>
      <li>Mechanistic yield optimization</li>
      <li>Stress-resilient plants</li>
      <li>Rational nutrient utilization</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Agriculture becomes a molecular science.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>6. Aging and Longevity</h3>
    <p>
      Aging is not random.
      It is governed by molecular transitions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cellular decline becomes explainable</li>
      <li>Degeneration becomes predictable</li>
      <li>Intervention becomes rational</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Longevity science becomes mechanistic, not speculative.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>7. Artificial Intelligence and Science</h3>
    <p>
      AI requires structure to reason.
      Biology has lacked it — until now.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Biological rules become machine-readable</li>
      <li>AI shifts from pattern matching to reasoning</li>
      <li>Discovery accelerates systematically</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology provides AI with something it never had:
      a coherent model of life.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block callout">
    <h3>8. What This Means</h3>
    <p>
      The implications are not incremental.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology enables:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Predictive medicine</li>
      <li>Rational biotechnology</li>
      <li>Reliable scientific progress</li>
      <li>Coherent biological education</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Biology becomes a true science.
    </p>
