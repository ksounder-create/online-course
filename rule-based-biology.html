    <h2>Rule-Based Biology</h2>
    <p class="hero-text">
      A complete, lawful framework of life — derived from data, not speculation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>1. What Rule-Based Biology Is</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology is a complete scientific framework that explains biological
      systems using governing rules rather than descriptions, correlations, or
      statistical inference.
    </p>
    <p>
      It defines how molecules behave, how processes unfold, and how biological
      outcomes arise — not probabilistically, but necessarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not a model.  
      It is not a hypothesis.  
      It is a rule-governed system.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>2. What Makes It Different</h3>
    <p>
      Traditional biology describes what happens.
      Rule-Based Biology explains why it must happen.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not descriptive → mechanistic</li>
      <li>Not probabilistic → deterministic</li>
      <li>Not fragmented → unified</li>
      <li>Not contextual → lawful</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once rules are known, outcomes are constrained.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>3. What the Rules Govern</h3>
    <p>
      The rules govern all levels of biological organization:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Molecular structure and conformation</li>
      <li>Post-translational modification</li>
      <li>Protein localization and function</li>
      <li>Signal transduction</li>
      <li>Energy utilization</li>
      <li>Replication and transcription</li>
      <li>Cellular decision-making</li>
      <li>Disease progression</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No biological process exists outside these rules.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>4. Why the Rules Were Hidden</h3>
    <p>
      The rules were never absent.
      They were obscured by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fragmented experimental design</li>
      <li>Over-specialization</li>
      <li>Contradictory interpretations</li>
      <li>Lack of integrative thinking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Only when viewed collectively do the rules become visible.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>5. What Happens When Rules Are Applied</h3>
    <p>
      When biological rules are applied:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contradictions collapse</li>
      <li>Mechanisms become inevitable</li>
      <li>Exceptions disappear</li>
      <li>Prediction becomes possible</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Biology becomes a lawful science.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>6. What This Means Practically</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology enables:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mechanistic disease understanding</li>
      <li>Predictable drug behavior</li>
      <li>Rational diagnostics</li>
      <li>Biological engineering</li>
      <li>True systems biology</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It replaces trial-and-error with logic.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>7. This Is Not a Theory</h3>
    <p>
      The rules are not speculative.
      They are derived from decades of experimental data.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is new is not the data — it is the interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The science is complete.
      What remains is dissemination.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block callout">
    <h3>8. What Comes Next</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology forms the foundation for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Medicine</li>
      <li>Biotechnology</li>
      <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
      <li>Education</li>
      <li>Scientific reasoning itself</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is not an evolution of biology.
      <br>
      It is a replacement.
