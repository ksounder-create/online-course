  <h2>Rule-Based Biology</h2>
  <p class="hero-text">
    A biological framework built on governing rules rather than descriptive accumulation.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <h3>What Rule-Based Biology Is</h3>

  <p>
    Rule-Based Biology is a reconstruction of biological science based on the discovery of
    governing rules that define how biological systems operate.
  </p>

  <p>
    It does not reinterpret existing biology.
    It does not extend current models.
    It does not rely on statistical correlation or contextual explanation.
  </p>

  <p>
    It identifies rules that determine:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>How molecules behave</li>
    <li>How biological processes are regulated</li>
    <li>How cellular decisions are made</li>
    <li>Why biological outcomes are consistent</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Once these rules are known, biological behavior becomes predictable and coherent.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="block">
  <h3>What Changed</h3>

  <p>
    For decades, biology operated without a governing framework.
    Observations accumulated, but explanations remained conditional.
  </p>

  <p>
    The discovery of rules changed this fundamentally.
  </p>

  <p>
    It revealed that:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Apparent contradictions were rule violations or misinterpretations</li>
    <li>Complexity arose from rule interaction, not randomness</li>
    <li>Biological processes follow strict logical constraints</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The same data that once appeared fragmented became internally consistent.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="block">
  <h3>What Rules Do</h3>

  <p>
    Rules define what is allowed, what is forbidden, and what must occur.
  </p>

  <p>
    In biology, this means:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Defining molecular behavior</li>
    <li>Constraining biological pathways</li>
    <li>Explaining regulation and control</li>
    <li>Eliminating ambiguity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Rules do not simplify biology by ignoring complexity.
    They simplify it by revealing structure.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="block">
  <h3>What This Replaces</h3>

  <p>
    Rule-Based Biology replaces:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Descriptive biology</li>
    <li>Context-dependent explanations</li>
    <li>Model proliferation without convergence</li>
    <li>Interpretive ambiguity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It replaces them not with opinion, but with necessity.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="block">
  <h3>What This Makes Possible</h3>

  <p>
    Once rules are known, biology becomes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Predictable</li>
    <li>Internally consistent</li>
    <li>Logically constrained</li>
    <li>Mechanistically explainable</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This changes how diseases are understood,
    how experiments are designed,
    and how biological knowledge progresses.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="block">
  <h3>The Central Outcome</h3>

  <p>
    The discovery of biological rules simultaneously:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Dismantles the old descriptive framework</li>
    <li>Explains why contradictions existed</li>
    <li>Reconstructs biology as a coherent science</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Rule-Based Biology is not a proposal.
    It is the consequence of discovering how biology actually works.
