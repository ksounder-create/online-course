  <h2>Why Biology Failed</h2>
  <p class="hero-text">
    Modern biology accumulated extraordinary amounts of data, yet failed to produce a coherent understanding of life.
  </p>
</section>

  <h3>The Central Paradox</h3>

  <p>
    Over the last century, biology has generated more experimental data than any other science.
    Yet fundamental biological processes remain poorly understood.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite advances in sequencing, imaging, and molecular techniques:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Core mechanisms remain disputed</li>
    <li>Findings are often contradictory</li>
    <li>Results are difficult to reproduce</li>
    <li>Models grow more complex but less explanatory</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This paradox cannot be explained by lack of data or effort.
  </p>
</section>

 <section class="block">
  <h3>The Real Cause</h3>

  <p>
    Biology was developed without a validated set of governing rules.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the absence of rules, biology evolved as a descriptive science:
    phenomena were cataloged, correlated, and named — but not structurally explained.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without rules:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Data could not be unified</li>
    <li>Contradictions could not be resolved</li>
    <li>Exceptions became the norm</li>
    <li>Models proliferated without convergence</li>
  </ul>
</section>
     
<section class="block">
  <h3>Why More Data Did Not Solve the Problem</h3>

  <p>
    Biology assumed that sufficient data would eventually reveal underlying principles.
    In practice, the opposite occurred.
  </p>

  <p>
    As data increased:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Interpretations multiplied</li>
    <li>Models became context-dependent</li>
    <li>Mechanisms became conditional</li>
    <li>Certainty decreased rather than increased</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is not a failure of experimentation.
    It is a consequence of working without governing rules.
  </p>
</section>

      <section class="block">
  <h3>The Limits of the Central Dogma</h3>

  <p>
    The central dogma described how biological information is transferred.
    It did not describe how biological systems are governed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, it became a placeholder for explanation rather than a foundation for understanding.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without rules to define molecular behavior, regulation, and interaction,
    biology remained mechanistic but not explanatory.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <h3>The Consequence</h3>

  <p>
    Biology became a science of accumulation rather than understanding.
  </p>

  <p>
    This led to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fragmented knowledge</li>
    <li>Endless specialization</li>
    <li>Inconsistent explanations</li>
    <li>Increasing dependence on interpretation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The problem was never lack of intelligence or effort.
    It was the absence of rules.
  </p>
</section>
      
<section class="block">
  <h3>The Turning Point</h3>

  <p>
    Once governing rules were identified, the situation changed immediately.
  </p>

  <p>
    Data that once appeared contradictory became coherent.
    Mechanisms that seemed complex became predictable.
    Biology became intelligible.
  </p>

  <p>
    The discovery of rules did not improve biology.
    It replaced the framework on which biology was built.

  <p>
    Biology did not fail because it lacked data.
    It failed because it lacked rules.
