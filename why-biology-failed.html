      <section class="intro">
        <p>
          Modern biology did not fail because of lack of intelligence, effort, or funding.
          It failed because it developed without governing rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          For decades, biology advanced as a descriptive enterprise—collecting data,
          naming phenomena, and proposing mechanisms—without ever identifying the laws
          that make scientific explanation possible.

      <section id="description-vs-understanding">
        <h3>1. Biology Confused Description With Understanding</h3>
        <p>
          Biology assumed that accumulating enough data would eventually yield understanding.
          This assumption was wrong.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pathways were described but not explained</li>
          <li>Mechanisms were inferred but not derived</li>
          <li>Models multiplied without convergence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Without governing rules, description replaced explanation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="absence-of-rules">
        <h3>2. The Absence of Rules</h3>
        <p>
          In mature sciences, laws constrain behavior and contradictions force correction.
          Biology lacked this corrective mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exceptions became normal. Context replaced causality.
          Nothing had to be resolved.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="data-explosion">
        <h3>3. The Data Explosion Made the Problem Worse</h3>
        <p>
          Experimental advances produced massive datasets, but without rules,
          integration became impossible.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          More data produced less understanding.
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="disease-failure">
        <h3>4. Disease Research Exposed the Failure</h3>
        <p>
          Cancer, diabetes, neurodegeneration, and pharmacology all reveal the same pattern:
          fragmentation without closure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Treatments remained trial-and-error because molecular behavior was never governed by laws.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="studied-yet-unclear">
        <h3>5. The Most Studied Systems Remained the Least Understood</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Mitochondria</li>
          <li>Calcium signaling</li>
          <li><em>E. coli</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If biology were converging, these systems would be simplest.
          Instead, they grew more paradoxical.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="why-it-continued">
        <h3>6. Why This Was Allowed to Continue</h3>
        <p>
          Biology lacked a failure signal. Contradictions were absorbed rather than rejected.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system rewarded data production, not coherence.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="ai-didnt-solve">
        <h3>7. Why AI and Big Data Didn’t Solve It</h3>
        <p>
          AI accelerated pattern detection but did not produce explanation.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Structure without rules is not understanding.
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="core-reason">
        <h3>8. The Core Reason Biology Failed</h3>
        <p>
          Biology attempted to function as a science without laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without laws, prediction fails and knowledge does not accumulate.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="inevitable">
        <h3>9. Why This Failure Was Inevitable</h3>
        <p>
          Without rules, complexity became chaos. The field could not converge.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="what-changed">
        <h3>10. What Changed</h3>
        <p>
          The rules have now been identified.
        </p>
        <p>
          With rules, contradictions collapse and mechanisms close.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="what-comes-next">
        <h3>11. What Comes Next</h3>
        <p>
          What replaces old biology is coherent, predictive, and mechanistic:
          <strong>Rule-Based Biology</strong>.

          Old biology did not fail because it lacked data.
          It failed because it lacked rules.
