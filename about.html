    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p class="hero-text">
      This site exists for one reason:
      <br>
      to present biology as a lawful, coherent science.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>Why This Exists</h3>
    <p>
      Modern biology has accumulated an extraordinary amount of data.
      Yet despite decades of research, core biological questions remain unresolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project exists because the problem was never a lack of data.
      It was the absence of governing rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without rules, data accumulates but understanding does not.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>What This Project Is</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology is an attempt to restore scientific coherence to biology.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not propose new experiments.
      It does not introduce speculative theories.
      It does not reinterpret biology emotionally or philosophically.
    </p>
    <p>
      It identifies the rules already embedded in experimental data and shows
      how those rules unify biological processes into a consistent system.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>What This Project Is Not</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It is not an alternative medicine platform</li>
      <li>It is not a philosophical movement</li>
      <li>It is not a personal opinion blog</li>
      <li>It is not a rejection of science</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It is a reconstruction of biology using scientific reasoning.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>Why This Approach Is Necessary</h3>
    <p>
      Biology became descriptive because it lacked unifying principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, this led to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contradictory models</li>
      <li>Fragmented knowledge</li>
      <li>Non-reproducible results</li>
      <li>Increasing complexity without clarity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology addresses this at the foundation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>The Guiding Principle</h3>
    <p>
      Nature is not arbitrary.
      Biological processes are not exceptions.
      Life obeys rules just as physics does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once those rules are identified, everything else follows.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>Why This Is Being Shared Publicly</h3>
    <p>
      Scientific progress depends on clarity, not authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work is shared openly so that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Students can learn without confusion</li>
      <li>Researchers can reason more effectively</li>
      <li>Biology can regain coherence</li>
      <li>Future work can be built on solid ground</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="block callout">
    <h3>What Comes Next</h3>
    <p>
      This site presents the framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further material — courses, detailed analyses, and applications —
      will follow once the foundation is understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is not speed.
      The goal is correctness.
    </p>
  </section>

      Science progresses when clarity replaces accumulation.
