  <h2>Why Rules</h2>
  <p class="hero-text">
    Science progresses only when phenomena are governed by rules.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <h3>What Rules Do</h3>

  <p>
    Rules define relationships.
    They explain why events occur, not merely that they occur.
  </p>

  <p>
    In every mature science, rules perform three functions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>They make observations intelligible</li>
    <li>They eliminate contradictions</li>
    <li>They allow prediction and reasoning</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Without rules, data remains descriptive.
    With rules, data becomes knowledge.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <h3>Why Biology Developed Without Rules</h3>

  <p>
    Biology evolved differently from physics or chemistry.
    Its objects of study were complex, variable, and difficult to isolate.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a result, biology developed as a descriptive science:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Observations were cataloged</li>
    <li>Correlations were reported</li>
    <li>Mechanisms were inferred</li>
    <li>Exceptions were tolerated</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Over time, this approach became institutionalized.
    Description replaced explanation.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <h3>Why Data Alone Could Not Produce Understanding</h3>

  <p>
    Biology assumed that increasing data would eventually reveal governing principles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead, the opposite occurred:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>More data produced more models</li>
    <li>More models produced more contradictions</li>
    <li>More contradictions required more exceptions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is not a failure of data.
    It is the inevitable result of working without rules.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <h3>What Rules Change</h3>

  <p>
    The introduction of rules changes biology fundamentally.
  </p>

  <p>
    When rules are known:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Data becomes interpretable</li>
    <li>Contradictions resolve themselves</li>
    <li>Mechanisms become predictable</li>
    <li>Exceptions disappear</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Rules do not add complexity.
    They remove it.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <h3>The Critical Realization</h3>

  <p>
    Rules are not created.
    They are discovered.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once discovered, they redefine the field.
    They determine what is possible, what is impossible,
    and what must be true.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is the point at which biology becomes a rational science.
  </p>

  <h3>What to Read Next</h3>

  <p>
    If you would like to continue, the following pages build naturally on this discovery:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="why-biology-failed.html">Why Biology Failed</a></strong><br>
      Explains why modern biology accumulated data without achieving coherence.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong><a href="why-rules.html">Why Rules</a></strong><br>
      Describes why scientific understanding requires governing rules.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong><a href="rule-based-biology.html">Rule-Based Biology</a></strong><br>
      Presents the framework that emerges once rules are identified.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong><a href="applications.html">Applications</a></strong><br>
      Shows how rule-based biology transforms medicine, research, and technology.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong><a href="students-and-careers.html">Students & Careers</a></strong><br>
      Explains what this shift means for learning, research, and future work.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These sections are designed to be read in order, but each can also stand on its own.
  </p>

<section class="block callout">
  <p>
    Rules give data meaning.<br>
    Rules demystify data.<br>
    Rules transform biology from description into understanding.
  </p>

  <footer class="page-footer">
    <p>
      Science progresses when rules are found.
      <br>
