    <h2>Why Rules</h2>
    <p class="hero-text">
      Science does not advance by accumulation.
      <br><br>
      It advances when governing rules are discovered.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>1. Science Without Rules Cannot Converge</h3>
    <p>
      Every mature science is defined by a small number of governing rules.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Physics has laws of motion and energy</li>
      <li>Chemistry has thermodynamics and bonding rules</li>
      <li>Engineering has constraints and conservation principles</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Biology, alone among the sciences, attempted to progress without rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was inevitable: description without closure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>2. Data Cannot Replace Laws</h3>
    <p>
      Modern biology assumed that enough data would eventually reveal truth.
      This assumption failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reveal correlations</li>
      <li>Expose patterns</li>
      <li>Suggest hypotheses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But data cannot:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Define necessity</li>
      <li>Eliminate contradictions</li>
      <li>Produce mechanism</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Only rules can do that.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>3. Why Biology Was Uniquely Vulnerable</h3>
    <p>
      Biology deals with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enormous molecular diversity</li>
      <li>Dynamic, non-linear systems</li>
      <li>Context-dependent behavior</li>
      <li>Multiple layers of regulation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Without rules, this complexity becomes unmanageable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of converging, biology fragmented.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>4. Why Rules Were Missed</h3>
    <p>
      The rules were not absent.
      They were hidden beneath:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Experimental noise</li>
      <li>Conflicting interpretations</li>
      <li>Contextual explanations</li>
      <li>Institutional inertia</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Without a rule-seeking framework, these signals could not be recognized.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>5. What Rules Actually Do</h3>
    <p>
      A rule does not describe behavior.
      It constrains it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a rule is known:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contradictions disappear</li>
      <li>Mechanisms become necessary</li>
      <li>Predictions become possible</li>
      <li>Exceptions vanish</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is what transforms a field into a science.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>6. Why Biology Now Converges</h3>
    <p>
      Biology is now uniquely positioned for rules to emerge because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data volume is enormous</li>
      <li>Patterns repeat across systems</li>
      <li>Contradictions are fully exposed</li>
      <li>Computation enables synthesis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What was missing was not information —
      it was a framework capable of recognizing laws.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>7. Rules Change Everything</h3>
    <p>
      Once biological rules are known:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Processes become predictable</li>
      <li>Diseases become mechanistic</li>
      <li>Drugs become rational tools</li>
      <li>Biology becomes engineerable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is not incremental progress.
      It is a phase transition.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block callout">
    <h3>8. What Comes Next</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology is not a theory.
      It is a completed framework derived from existing data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next step is to understand what those rules are
      — and what they reveal.
