    <h2>Diabetes: A Case Study in the Failure of Modern Biology</h2>
    <p class="hero-text">
      Diabetes is not a mystery.
      <br>
      It only appears mysterious because biology has been interpreted without rules.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>1. The Paradox of Diabetes</h3>
    <p>
      Diabetes is one of the most studied diseases in history.
      Yet:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Its molecular cause remains unclear</li>
      <li>Its progression is poorly predicted</li>
      <li>Its treatment is largely symptomatic</li>
      <li>Its complications are treated, not explained</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is not due to lack of data.
      It is due to lack of rules.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>2. The Traditional Explanation — and Its Failure</h3>
    <p>
      Conventional biology explains diabetes as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Insulin deficiency (Type 1)</li>
      <li>Insulin resistance (Type 2)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These descriptions are observational, not mechanistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      They do not explain:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Why insulin resistance arises</li>
      <li>Why tissues respond differently</li>
      <li>Why progression varies</li>
      <li>Why treatment effects are inconsistent</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>3. The Core Problem: Lack of a Governing Framework</h3>
    <p>
      Insulin action is typically described as a signaling pathway.
      This is misleading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without rules governing:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Phosphorylation states</li>
      <li>Protein localization</li>
      <li>Energy handling</li>
      <li>Cellular decision-making</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      “Insulin resistance” becomes a label, not an explanation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>4. What Rule-Based Biology Reveals</h3>
    <p>
      Under a rule-based framework:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Insulin action is not binary</li>
      <li>Signal direction depends on phosphorylation rules</li>
      <li>Energy handling determines cellular response</li>
      <li>Resistance emerges as a logical outcome</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Diabetes becomes a consequence of rule violation, not a random failure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>5. Why Current Treatments Plateau</h3>
    <p>
      Current therapies focus on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lowering glucose</li>
      <li>Increasing insulin</li>
      <li>Modulating receptors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But they do not address:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The underlying molecular state</li>
      <li>The energy logic of the cell</li>
      <li>The rule-based cause of resistance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As a result, progression continues.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>6. What Changes With Rules</h3>
    <p>
      When biological rules are applied:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Insulin signaling becomes predictable</li>
      <li>Resistance becomes explainable</li>
      <li>Intervention points become clear</li>
      <li>Progression becomes preventable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Diabetes shifts from a chronic condition to a mechanistic state.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>7. Why Diabetes Is the Ideal Example</h3>
    <p>
      Diabetes illustrates everything wrong with old biology:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Massive data, little understanding</li>
      <li>Symptoms mistaken for causes</li>
      <li>Pathways without governing logic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      And everything right about Rule-Based Biology:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mechanism replaces correlation</li>
      <li>Rules replace assumptions</li>
      <li>Understanding replaces trial-and-error</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="block callout">
    <h3>8. The Larger Implication</h3>
    <p>
      Diabetes is not unique.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a representative example of what happens
      when biology is studied without rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the rules are known,
      the disease ceases to be mysterious.
