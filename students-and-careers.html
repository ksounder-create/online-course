    <h2>Students &amp; Careers</h2>
    <p class="hero-text">
      Biology is being rewritten.
      <br>
      Your career should not be built on an outdated foundation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>1. The Problem With Studying Biology Today</h3>
    <p>
      Most students enter biology with curiosity and enthusiasm.
      What they encounter instead is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Memorization without understanding</li>
      <li>Contradictory explanations</li>
      <li>Unresolvable mechanisms</li>
      <li>Years of study with little conceptual closure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is not because biology is inherently confusing.
      It is because it has been taught without rules.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>2. Why This Matters for Your Career</h3>
    <p>
      A career built on descriptive science has limits.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Research becomes incremental</li>
      <li>Progress depends on trial-and-error</li>
      <li>Understanding plateaus</li>
      <li>Specialization becomes a trap</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology changes the trajectory entirely.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>3. What Rule-Based Biology Offers Students</h3>
    <p>
      Instead of memorizing facts, students learn:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How biological systems are structured</li>
      <li>Why molecules behave the way they do</li>
      <li>How mechanisms emerge from rules</li>
      <li>How to reason across disciplines</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Understanding replaces memorization.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>4. For Researchers and Scientists</h3>
    <p>
      Most researchers spend years chasing results that cannot converge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology offers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mechanistic clarity</li>
      <li>Predictive reasoning</li>
      <li>Faster hypothesis testing</li>
      <li>Reduced experimental waste</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Research becomes rational instead of exploratory.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>5. For Medical and Health Professionals</h3>
    <p>
      Medicine today is largely empirical.
    </p>
    <p>
      With rule-based understanding:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Diseases gain mechanistic clarity</li>
      <li>Treatments become predictable</li>
      <li>Diagnosis becomes explanatory</li>
      <li>Therapy becomes rational</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Clinical intuition is replaced by understanding.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>6. For Engineers, Physicists, and AI Practitioners</h3>
    <p>
      Biology has long resisted formalization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology changes that.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Biology becomes computable</li>
      <li>Models become interpretable</li>
      <li>AI gains true structure</li>
      <li>Cross-disciplinary work becomes possible</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>7. A Different Kind of Education</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology is not another course.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Concept-first, not syllabus-first</li>
      <li>Rule-driven, not memorization-driven</li>
      <li>Independent of institutions</li>
      <li>Grounded in logic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once learned, it changes how you think — permanently.
    </p>

  <section class="block callout">
    <h3>8. The Choice</h3>
    <p>
      You can follow the traditional path:
      memorize, specialize, and hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or you can learn the rules that govern life itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second path is shorter, clearer, and future-proof.
