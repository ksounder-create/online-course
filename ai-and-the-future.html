  <h3>The Limitation of AI Today</h3>

  <p>
    Modern AI systems are exceptionally good at identifying patterns.
    However, pattern recognition is not understanding.
  </p>

  <p>
    In biology, AI is trained on data that is:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fragmented</li>
    <li>Contradictory</li>
    <li>Context-dependent</li>
    <li>Largely descriptive</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    As a result, AI systems learn correlations without mechanisms.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="block">
  <h3>Why AI Struggles With Biology</h3>

  <p>
    Biology lacks a consistent rule framework.
    Without rules, AI cannot distinguish signal from noise.
  </p>

  <p>
    This leads to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Models that work only in narrow contexts</li>
    <li>Poor generalization</li>
    <li>Uninterpretable predictions</li>
    <li>Dependence on massive data volumes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    AI is forced to compensate for the absence of structure.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="block">
  <h3>Why Rules Change Everything</h3>

  <p>
    Rules provide constraints.
    Constraints make learning possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    When biological rules are known:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Search spaces collapse</li>
    <li>Predictions become testable</li>
    <li>Models become interpretable</li>
    <li>Errors become diagnosable</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    AI no longer guesses.
    It reasons within boundaries.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="block">
  <h3>Rule-Based Biology as AI Infrastructure</h3>

  <p>
    Rule-Based Biology provides what AI has always lacked:
    a coherent, mechanistic foundation.
  </p>

  <p>
    This enables:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Model training on principles rather than correlations</li>
    <li>Explainable predictions</li>
    <li>Causal reasoning</li>
    <li>Cross-domain generalization</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In this context, AI becomes a tool for reasoning —
    not a substitute for understanding.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="block">
  <h3>Implications for the Future</h3>

  <p>
    When AI is combined with rule-based biology:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Drug discovery becomes mechanistic</li>
    <li>Biological simulation becomes feasible</li>
    <li>Prediction replaces trial-and-error</li>
    <li>Knowledge scales without losing coherence</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is not faster science.
    It is a different kind of science.
