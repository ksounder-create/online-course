    <h2>AI &amp; the Future of Science</h2>
    <p class="hero-text">
      Artificial Intelligence has reached a ceiling — not because of computation,
      but because science itself lacks rules.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>1. Why AI Alone Cannot Solve Biology</h3>
    <p>
      Modern AI excels at pattern recognition.
      Biology, however, is not a pattern problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without governing rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Patterns cannot be interpreted</li>
      <li>Predictions cannot be trusted</li>
      <li>Generalization fails</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      AI amplifies whatever structure exists.
      If the structure is missing, AI amplifies confusion.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>2. The Limit of “AI for Science”</h3>
    <p>
      Current AI-driven science focuses on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Correlation discovery</li>
      <li>Structure prediction</li>
      <li>High-dimensional pattern matching</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are powerful tools — but they are not understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      AlphaFold demonstrated this clearly:
      structure could be predicted, but function remained elusive.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>3. Why Biology Is the Bottleneck</h3>
    <p>
      Biology is the most complex domain AI attempts to model.
      Yet it is also the least structured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Models cannot generalize</li>
      <li>Predictions cannot extrapolate</li>
      <li>Reasoning collapses into statistics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      AI cannot compensate for missing scientific foundations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>4. What Rule-Based Biology Changes</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology provides exactly what AI lacks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explicit constraints</li>
      <li>Deterministic relationships</li>
      <li>Mechanistic causality</li>
      <li>Predictable system behavior</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This transforms AI from a pattern recognizer into a reasoning system.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>5. From Data-Driven to Rule-Guided AI</h3>
    <p>
      With biological rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>AI can test hypotheses instead of guessing</li>
      <li>Predictions become explainable</li>
      <li>Models become verifiable</li>
      <li>Discovery accelerates logically</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      AI becomes a tool of science, not a substitute for it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>6. The Future of Science Is Rule-Based</h3>
    <p>
      When rules exist:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discovery becomes systematic</li>
      <li>Knowledge becomes cumulative</li>
      <li>Technology scales predictably</li>
      <li>Education becomes coherent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Biology is the last major science to undergo this transition.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block callout">
    <h3>7. What This Means</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology does not compete with AI.
      It completes it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, they enable:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>True scientific reasoning</li>
      <li>Predictive medicine</li>
      <li>Rational biotechnology</li>
      <li>Accelerated discovery</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is not an upgrade.
      <br>
      It is a foundation.
