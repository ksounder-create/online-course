    <h2>Biology finally becomes a real science.</h2>
    <p class="hero-text">
      For over half a century, biology generated massive amounts of data — and almost no certainty.
      <br><br>
      Pathways multiplied. Mechanisms contradicted one another. Diseases remained poorly understood.
      <br><br>
      This was not because life is mysterious.
      <br><br>
      <strong>It was because biology lacked rules.</strong>
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>What went wrong</h3>
    <p>
      Modern biology assumed that accumulating enough data would eventually produce understanding.
      That assumption failed.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contradictions became acceptable</li>
      <li>Context replaced causality</li>
      <li>Memorization replaced reasoning</li>
      <li>Prediction became impossible</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Biology became a descriptive science — not an explanatory one.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>What Rule-Based Biology is</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology™ is a complete, law-driven framework of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is <strong>not an improvement</strong> of biochemistry or molecular biology.
      It is <strong>their replacement</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules define:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How molecular functional groups behave</li>
      <li>How conformations change dynamically</li>
      <li>How structure, location, and energy determine function</li>
      <li>How biological processes arise lawfully</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once the rules are known, the mechanisms follow automatically.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>Why this works</h3>
    <p>
      This framework does not depend on new experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It reorganizes what already exists:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Decades of published research</li>
      <li>Thousands of drug studies</li>
      <li>Millions of experimental observations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When the rules are applied, contradictions collapse and biology becomes coherent.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>This is not academic reform</h3>
    <p>
      We are not seeking peer approval.
      <br>
      We are not preserving legacy frameworks.
      <br>
      We are not negotiating with authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the release of finished science as a new discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Authority does not decide truth.
      <br>
      <strong>Rules do.</strong>
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>What this enables</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mechanistic understanding of disease</li>
      <li>Predictable drug behavior</li>
      <li>Rational diagnostics</li>
      <li>Engineering of biological systems</li>
      <li>A foundation for AI grounded in life</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>Who this is for</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Students who don’t want to memorize contradictions</li>
      <li>Researchers tired of irreproducible results</li>
      <li>Physicians seeking mechanistic clarity</li>
      <li>Pharmacologists who want predictability</li>
      <li>Scientists from physics, engineering, and AI</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you can think rationally, you are qualified.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block callout">
    <h3>What comes next</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology™ is being released as a complete online framework.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>End-to-end</li>
      <li>Independent of institutions</li>
      <li>Built for understanding, not memorization</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Early access provides understanding — not validation.
