    <p>
      Biology has accumulated enormous data.  
      What it lacked was a validated foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology is not an improvement of modern biology.  
      It is a radical reconstruction of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It replaces descriptive accumulation with a rule-based understanding of life.

    <h3>From Data to Understanding</h3>
    <p>
      From data to laws.  
      From confusion to understanding.  
      From complexity to coherence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>What Is Rule-Based Biology?</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology reconstructs biological systems by identifying the governing
      rules that define how molecules, cells, and processes behave.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not interpret data.
      It aligns data with defining rules.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
  <h3>The Discovery</h3>

  <p>
    The central achievement of this work is the discovery of governing rules in biology.
  </p>

  <p>
    These rules were not hypothesized or assumed. They were identified through systematic
    analysis of experimental data accumulated over decades.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once these rules were recognized, two consequences became unavoidable:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Much of modern biology collapses as a descriptive framework.</li>
    <li>A coherent, rule-based biology emerges in its place.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The discovery of rules did not extend existing biology.
    It dismantled it — and simultaneously made a new, rational biology possible.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>Why This Exists</h3>
    <p>
      Modern biology developed without a validated foundation.
      As a result, explanations became fragmented, conditional, and contradictory.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project exists to correct that.
      It provides a validated central framework for understanding life.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>What Makes This Different</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-Based Biology does not add another theory or model.
    </p>
    <p>
      It reconstructs biology from governing rules and resolves contradictions
      instead of accommodating them.

    <p>
      Students who seek understanding instead of memorization.

      Anyone interested in how life actually works.

      When rules are known, complexity disappears.  
      Biology becomes rational.
