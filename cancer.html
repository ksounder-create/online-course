    <h2>Cancer: A Case Study in the Failure of Descriptive Biology</h2>
    <p class="hero-text">
      Cancer is not mysterious.
      <br>
      It has simply been interpreted without rules.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>1. The Paradox of Cancer Research</h3>
    <p>
      Cancer is one of the most intensely studied biological phenomena in history.
      Yet:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No unified mechanism exists</li>
      <li>Each cancer is treated as a separate disease</li>
      <li>Therapies remain probabilistic</li>
      <li>Relapse is common</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is not due to lack of data.
      It is due to lack of governing principles.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>2. The Traditional View — and Why It Fails</h3>
    <p>
      Conventional biology defines cancer as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Genetic mutations</li>
      <li>Loss of growth control</li>
      <li>Aberrant signaling</li>
      <li>Uncontrolled proliferation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are descriptions, not explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      They do not explain:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Why mutations accumulate in specific ways</li>
      <li>Why proliferation begins</li>
      <li>Why cancer follows reproducible patterns</li>
      <li>Why therapies fail predictably</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>3. The Core Error: Treating Cancer as Genetic Chaos</h3>
    <p>
      Cancer is commonly portrayed as randomness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This assumption is incorrect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under a rule-based framework:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mutation is not primary</li>
      <li>Proliferation is not accidental</li>
      <li>Signaling is not random</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Cancer follows rules — but those rules were never identified.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>4. What Rule-Based Biology Reveals</h3>
    <p>
      When biological rules are applied:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cell-cycle dysregulation becomes predictable</li>
      <li>Proliferation follows energy-state rules</li>
      <li>Signaling shifts are deterministic</li>
      <li>Transformation follows lawful transitions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Cancer emerges as a *state*, not a mutation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>5. Why Targeted Therapies Plateau</h3>
    <p>
      Modern oncology targets:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Receptors</li>
      <li>Kinases</li>
      <li>Checkpoints</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But without rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Compensatory pathways activate</li>
      <li>Resistance inevitably emerges</li>
      <li>Relapse becomes predictable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is not failure of drugs — it is failure of framework.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>6. Cancer as a Predictable Biological State</h3>
    <p>
      Under Rule-Based Biology:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cancer progression follows defined stages</li>
      <li>Energy handling dictates growth behavior</li>
      <li>Signal dominance determines phenotype</li>
      <li>Reversibility becomes possible in early states</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Cancer is not chaos.
      It is biology operating under altered constraints.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block">
    <h3>7. Why Cancer Proves the Need for Rules</h3>
    <p>
      Cancer exposes every weakness of descriptive biology:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Correlation mistaken for causation</li>
      <li>Pathways without logic</li>
      <li>Data without synthesis</li>
      <li>Therapy without understanding</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It also demonstrates why rules are unavoidable.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="block callout">
    <h3>8. The Larger Meaning</h3>
    <p>
      Cancer is not a special case.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the clearest example of what happens
      when biology is studied without laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the rules are known,
      cancer ceases to be mysterious.
